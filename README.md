##The Front-End Course Progress Tracker is a web-based application that allows users to track their learning progress across various front-end development topics, including HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. This system provides an intuitive interface where users can interact with course content, mark lessons as completed, and visualize their progress dynamically.

By leveraging HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Local Storage, this project ensures a seamless and persistent tracking experience without requiring a backend. The progress data is stored locally in the browser, allowing users to resume their learning without losing their achievements.

Features
1. Course Dashboard (index.html)
The homepage features a progress tracker displaying the user's overall completion percentage.
Clicking on the "Front-End" template navigates users to the detailed course page (frontend.html).
Progress is calculated dynamically based on the lessons completed in each section.
2. Course Content Page (frontend.html)
Organized into three sections: HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS.
Each section consists of multiple lessons represented as clickable images.
Clicking an image marks the corresponding lesson as completed and updates the progress bar.
3. Real-Time Progress Tracking
The system uses JavaScript and Local Storage to track completed lessons.
Each lesson is stored in the browser, allowing progress to persist even after the page is refreshed.
The overall progress is displayed both on frontend.html and index.html.
Technical Implementation
1. Front-End Development
The project uses:
--> HTML to structure the course content.
--> CSS for styling and grid layouts.
--> JavaScript to handle user interactions and track progress.

2. Local Storage for Progress Management
The project utilizes localStorage to store completed lessons.
Whenever a user clicks on a lesson image, its ID is saved in Local Storage.
Progress updates dynamically and is retrieved when the user revisits the page.
3. Dynamic Progress Bar Update
The <progress> element reflects the percentage of lessons completed.
Each lesson is counted towards the overall completion percentage.
The progress is updated on both frontend.html (individual progress) and index.html (overall progress).
Workflow
   --> User visits index.html and sees the front-end course card with a progress bar.
   --> Clicking the card navigates to frontend.html, where lessons are displayed.
   --> User clicks on a lesson image, marking it as complete.
   --> The progress bar updates in real-time, and data is saved using localStorage.
   --> When the user returns to index.html, the overall progress is calculated and displayed.

Use Cases
Self-paced Learning: Users can track their progress as they learn front-end technologies.
Educational Platforms: This functionality can be integrated into online courses and e-learning websites.
Portfolio Project: A great demonstration of JavaScript skills, including event handling and local storage.

The Front-End Course Progress Tracker provides an interactive and persistent learning experience. By implementing a real-time progress tracking system, this project enhances user engagement and motivates learners to complete their courses. Future enhancements could include user authentication, a backend database for storing progress, and additional course modules.
